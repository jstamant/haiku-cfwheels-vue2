# Haiku App using CFWheels and Vue2

This is a learning project to get the basics of CFML, CFWheels, and
Vue2.

## Running

Start the development environment using `box` from the backend directory.

```bash
cd backend
box
server start
```

## Requests

If you want to test HTTP requests to the backend, you'll need to
request the `json` format when sending a request:

`GET http://localhost:port/haiku?format=json`
